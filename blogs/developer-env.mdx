## The Dock

I keep my dock as minimal as possible with only the apps that i use daily. [Zed](https://zed.dev/) is here because i am trying it out and it is preety fast code editor.

## Developer Tools/Apps

### VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my go-to code editor and i have so many extensions installed. Here are some of my favs:

- [Catppuccino](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc) - My theme of choice
- [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) - For Colorful comments to make them stand out
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - For auto formatting
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - For git blame and other git features
- [Pretty Typescript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YoavBls.pretty-ts-errors) - For cleaned typescript error messages
- and 68 more...

### Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.
I use Oh My Zsh with the Powerlevel10k theme. You can get my .zshrc config from the github repo linked above.

### Warp

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is my current terminal of choice because of its feature rich AI capabilities. I used to use iTerm2 but i am trying out Warp and so far i am loving it.

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for MacOS and it is a must have for every mac developer.

- e.g. - `brew install node` to install node.

### NVM

[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a node version manager. Its quite useful when you have multiple projects with different node versions.

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized applications.

### Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing & development.

### NeoVim

Although i use VSCode for most of my work but i like to use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for quick edits and for editing config files.

### Chrome

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is default for development / testing.

### Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is my go-to design tool.

## Other Apps that i use

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - For notes and project management
- [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) - I like to keep everything organized and Arc Browser helps me with that using its Spaces feature and it also has some other cool features like tidy tabs etc.
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - For window management
