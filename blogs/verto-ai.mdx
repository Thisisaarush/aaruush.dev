## 🚩 Problem

Customer support teams face:

- High volume of repetitive questions
- Slow response times

## 🎯 Goal

Build a platform where organizations can:

- Upload their documents
- Instantly deploy an AI chatbot
- Answer customer questions accurately

## 🏗 Architecture

Monorepo using PNPM workspaces and Turborepo.

### Applications

- `apps/web` → Admin Dashboard
- `apps/widget` → Chat Widget
- `apps/embed` → Script Loader

### Packages

- `packages/backend` → Convex schema & AI logic
- `packages/ui` → Shared components

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI

- Jotai

**Backend**

- Convex (DB + serverless)
- Convex RAG
- Convex Agent

**AI**

- Google Gemini 2.5

**Auth**

---

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. Admin uploads documents
2. Documents are chunked & embedded
3. User sends message from widget
4. Query searches embeddings
5. Context injected into prompt
6. Gemini generates answer
7. Optional human escalation

---

## 🧩 Database Design

- organizations
- users
- conversations
- messages
- knowledge_documents
- embeddings
- widget_config

Each entity is scoped by organization.

---

## ⚙️ Key Technical Challenges

### Multi-Tenancy

Each organization must have isolated data and configuration.

**Solution:**  
All tables scoped by `organizationId`.

---

### Real-Time Messaging

Need instant updates between widget and dashboard.

**Solution:**  
Convex real-time subscriptions.

---

### Accurate AI Responses

LLMs hallucinate without context.

**Solution:**  
RAG pipeline with document embeddings.

---

### Embeddable Widget

Should work on any site.

**Solution:**  
Script loader that injects iframe-based widget.

---

## 📈 Result

- Fully functional SaaS MVP
- Production-ready architecture
- Reusable starter kit for client projects

---

## 💡 Learnings
