A scalable e-commerce backend built with microservices architecture, ensuring reliability, fault tolerance, and efficient deployments. This project has earned **75+ ⭐ stars on GitHub**.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Traditional monolithic e-commerce backends face:

- Scaling bottlenecks during high traffic
- Single point of failure
- Difficult deployments and updates
- Tight coupling between features
- Complex payment integrations

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build a production-ready e-commerce backend that:

- Scales horizontally with demand
- Handles failures gracefully
- Enables independent service deployments
- Processes payments securely
- Maintains high availability

---

## ✅ Solution

I designed and built a microservices-based e-commerce backend featuring:

- Independent, loosely-coupled services
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Load balancing with Nginx
- Containerized deployments with Docker

---

## 🧱 Services & Features

### User Service

- User registration
- Authentication with JWT
- Password hashing with argon2

### Product Service

- Product listings management
- Categories organization
- Inventory tracking

### Shopping Cart Service

- Add/remove items
- Update quantities

- SMS notifications via Twilio

---

## 🏗 Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

- Each service is a separate codebase with its own database
- Loosely coupled, independently deployable

### API Gateway & Load Balancing

- Nginx routes requests to appropriate services
- Load balancer distributes traffic across service instances

### Containerization & Deployment

- Docker containerizes each service
- Kubernetes manages production deployment
- Provides scalability, fault tolerance, and self-healing

### CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions automates build, test, and deploy
- Docker Hub integration for image storage

### Database & Auth

- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT for authentication
- argon2 for password hashing

## ⚙️ Key Technical Challenges

### Service Communication

Microservices need reliable inter-service communication.

**Solution:**  
REST APIs with retry logic and circuit breakers.

---

### Data Consistency

Distributed services make consistency challenging.

**Solution:**  
Event-driven architecture with eventual consistency.

---

### Deployment Complexity

Multiple services need coordinated deployments.

**Solution:**  
Kubernetes manifests with rolling update strategy.

---

### Payment Security

Handling sensitive payment data securely.

**Solution:**  
Stripe integration with PCI-compliant tokenization.

---

## 📈 Result

- 75+ GitHub stars
- Production-ready architecture
- Horizontally scalable
- Fault-tolerant design

---

## 💡 Learnings

- Microservices add complexity but improve scalability
- Kubernetes simplifies container orchestration
- Stripe provides excellent developer experience
- Proper error handling is critical in distributed systems

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Message queue for async processing
- Distributed tracing
- GraphQL API gateway
- Caching layer with Redis
